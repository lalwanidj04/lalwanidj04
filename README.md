Hi, Iâ€™m Devanshi Lalwani
I am a third-year Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in full-stack development and problem-solving. Passionate about building efficient and scalable web applications, I have experience working with technologies like React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. My primary programming languages are Java, JavaScript, and SQL, and I enjoy exploring new tools and frameworks to enhance my development skills.

Currently, I am focused on advancing my backend development knowledge, particularly in system design and database optimization. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and integrating best practices into my projects. Hands-on experience with personal and academic projects has helped me strengthen my understanding of full-stack development, from designing intuitive user interfaces to implementing robust server-side logic.

I am always eager to collaborate on exciting projects, contribute to open-source initiatives, and work with like-minded developers to create impactful solutions. If you are working on an interesting project or looking for a developer to team up with, feel free to reach out.
